            <p style="text-align: justify;">Yeagerist Highschool is a school that teach people to learn what is &quot;humanity&quot;, &quot;responsibility&quot; and &quot;consequences&quot;. We believe that our world doesn't need <i>smart people but caring people</i> who will lend someone in need a hand. Right now, <b>many people help other to become viral or to become famous not because they really care</b>, that's why our school will provide lesson more focus on human behaviour. We learn that our world education system teach about competition not teamwork, all student compete against each other to get A sometimes they even sacrifice their humanity or talent to achieve that. That system is the reason why many student hate school because it's always about competition, or sacrifice.</p>
